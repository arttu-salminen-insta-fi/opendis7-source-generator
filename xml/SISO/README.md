## SISO-REF-010: Reference for Enumerations for Simulation Interoperability

From SISO website:
SISO-REF-010 specifies numerical values and associated definitions for fields
that are identified as enumerations in SISO Standards Products and
SISO-sponsored standards published by IEEE for High Level Architecture (HLA) and
Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). Enumerations for simulations may be applied
in other architectures, such as the Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA).
SISO Product Data Files associated with this product are included in the above link,
but just the PDF is available separately for the enumerations and OPMAN.
